	<h1>HTML Block and Inline Elements</h1>
	<p>Every HTML element has a default display value depending on what type of element it is. The default display value for most elements is block or inline.</p>
	<p>A <strong>block-level</strong> element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).</p>
	<p>An <strong>inline</strong> element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.</p>
	<hr>

	<!-- You can have multiple classes but only one ID -->
	<h1>Classes and IDs</h1>
	<p>The class attribute specifies one or more class names for an HTML element.</p>
	<p class="blue">This p element has a class attribute of blue</p>
	<p>The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element (the value must be unique within the HTML document).</p>
	<p id="cats">This p element has an id attribute of cats</p>
	<p>Both classes and ids can be accessed by CSS, JavaScript and other technologies for various puposes and uses.</p>
	<hr>

	<h1>Iframes</h1>
	<p>An iframe is used to display a web page within a web page.</p>
	<p>Below is an example of an iframe of the website Wikipedia.</p>
	<iframe src="https://www.wikipedia.org" height="300" width="500"></iframe>
	<hr>

	<h1>HTML5 Canvas</h1>
	<p>The HTML canvas element is used to draw graphics, on the fly, via JavaScript.</p> 
	<p>The canvas element is only a container for graphics. You must use JavaScript to actually draw the graphics.</p>
	<p>Canvas has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and adding images.</p>
	<canvas id="myCanvas" width="200" height="100" style="border:1px solid #000000;">
	</canvas>
